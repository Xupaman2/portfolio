Hi! I'm Sue Pha â€” an aspiring Software Developer and Data Analyst with a strong foundation in IT support, automation, and data visualization.

I have hands-on experience using tools like Power BI, SQL, Python, and PowerShell to troubleshoot systems, automate repetitive tasks, and uncover insights from data. I've built dashboards, written system-monitoring scripts, and contributed to performance improvements in enterprise environments.

I'm currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science, with an A.S. in Information Technology already completed. I'm actively seeking opportunities where I can continue growing and contribute meaningfully as a developer or analyst.
